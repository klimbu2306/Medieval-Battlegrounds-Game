# Medieval-Battlegrounds-Game
This is a 3D battlegrounds game I developed as a passion project.

### 🖥️ Repository Structure Explanation
---
Inside the repo, instead of a `src` folder, there are two main branching `src` folders:

1. `ServerScripts` (for Networking, Data, Security)

2. `ClientScripts` (for Physics Simulation, VFX, UI / UX Interface)

Within `ServerScripts` and `ClientScripts` there are further _sub-directories_ that contain modules - and **importing this repo requires that you place code in the exact directories that have been specified!**
